# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Security updates will generally target the latest stable release and the default branch. Pre-release versions may not receive backports unless critical.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

1. Go to the repository Security tab and use "Report a vulnerability" if available.
2. Alternatively, email the maintainer or create a private advisory. If unsure, use the Security contact link in the issue templates config.
3. Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce and potential impact.

We will investigate and respond as quickly as possible. Thank you for helping keep the community safe.
